TOP.ONE API Documentation
==========================

This repository holds the `slate` based documentation for the TOP.ONE HTTP and Websocket based public facing API.
This is a complete content rewrite of the documentation without changes to the API's functionality.

Edits
-----

All content lives in [source/](source/). Each section is an included file in the [source/includes/](source/includes/)
directory. Once you have edited a file, reloading the browser will show the incorporated changes.

Deploy
------

To deploy a set of flat files:

```bundle exec middleman build --clean```

Everything should end up in the `build/` directory.
