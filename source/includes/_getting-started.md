# Getting Started

### Sign Up

If you do not have a TOP.ONE account yet, use the button below to sign up.

<a href="https://top.one/user/register" target="_blank" class="sign-up-btn">Sign Up</a>

### Create appId and appKey

Once you are verified and have an account, you can login in [TOP.ONE](https://top.one), visit the user center page, ask for your appId and appKey.

It is recommended to bind a static IP when creating them to improving security. 

As the name implies, your secret must remain private! If you suspect your key has been compromised, immediately disable that key and generate a new one.

### Get API Token

Token is used for order authentication.

The Token is valid for several hours, you should get a new one every hour.
    
> Request: Get API Token 

```shell
# The frequency of interface requests is limited to one time per minute. 
# Do not request frequently, otherwise it will be blocked for one hour.
  
# The sig is generated by SHA256 encryption of the parameters(appKey,random,time).
 echo -n "appKey=xxxxxxxx&random=200022&time=1409309229" | openssl sha256
 
# You will use this signature in your request.
# For example:
 curl "https://gateway.topone.run/u/v1/api/token?appId=xxx&random=200022&time=1409309229&sig=2a7849ecfae71161c8e9a364e21d9de9"
